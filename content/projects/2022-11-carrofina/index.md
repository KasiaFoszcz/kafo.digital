    I worked with Kasia on a software design and implementation project of a new
    e-commerce platform. Kasia designed the functional flow and UI from the
    scratch. She was able to successfully guide us through the design process.
    Kasia is open-minded and hard-working person with wide knowledge and
    experience around UI/UX design. I honestly recommend Kasia for any UI/UX
    design related position.
