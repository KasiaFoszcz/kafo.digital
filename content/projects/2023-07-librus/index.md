    I worked with Kasia on a large project in the area of applications for
    educational institutions. Kasia was responsible for conceptual work on the
    project and for preparing the full design of the system. The collaboration
    involved many hours of meetings, discussions, and analysis of the client's
    needs.

    The collaboration at each of these stages was excellent - Kasia is
    communicative and greatly helped us in specifying our project expectations.
    As a product designer, she presented us with interesting visual proposals,
    which allowed us to jointly develop the final look of the application.

    In working with Kasia, I especially appreciate her creativity, flexibility,
    and very good communication.

    I can wholeheartedly recommend working with Kasia.

## About

Librus is a leading edutech company on Polish market. Over 5 million students
use their tools on a daily basis.

## The challenge

Creation of a management tool for principals, mostly non-technical and aged 50+,
hence a firm focus on a simple user flow. Multiple stakeholders responsible for
various aspects of Librus' business activity were engaged in the process and
making the tool go live within a quarter from the start of the project is our
common success.
