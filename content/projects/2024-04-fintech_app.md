## About

Wealth management mobile app for a non-EU market, which entailed understanding
and adapting to different regulatory obligations. Working closely with a startup
client.

## The challenge

Adjusting the product design process to deliver the greatest value to the client
within existing time and budget constraints.

We worked in fast-paced iterations, each refining the app's relevance for the
end user. After each iteration, I delivered a prototype for testing with users,
allowing us to gather valuable feedback to inform the next steps. Initially, our
focus was on defining the app's functionality and ensuring that it solved users'
problems. As we transitioned to the final stages, I made sure to deliver
high-fidelity designs and prototypes incorporating the client's branding.

Due to a non-disclosure agreement, I cannot currently publish the effects of my
work or client data. The image above is my design of a visually and functionally
different fintech app.
