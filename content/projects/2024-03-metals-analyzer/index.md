    The Metal Phases Analyzer is a valuable tool for my research as it
    streamlines sample analysis. The flexibility in choosing clustering method
    parameters allows me to adjust them to fit my expectations for each sample's
    structure. This enhances my control and confidence in the results obtained.

## About

This application clusters metal phases and outputs the mechanical properties of
each phase. It was developed for researchers from Wroclaw University of Science
and Technology to streamline the analysis of novel amorphous metals they
produce.

It is my Data Science postgraduate project at the Wroclaw University of
Economics and Business.

## The challenge

Creation of an easy-to-use tool to make metal analysis faster. Design and
development of a Streamlit web application with a few well-described clustering
methods to choose from.
