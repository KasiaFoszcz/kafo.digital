    Katarzyna has worked for Labyrinth Drives LTD and has been responsible for a
    UX/UI design of a PC application for encrypted data cloud backup. The main
    challenge in this project has been the user flow created for a security
    product involving a mobile app, an SSD with encryption and the PC
    application itself. She has handled her work with a high level of diligence,
    giving our product the expected level of security and usability. Thank you
    for that, and good luck.
